Update on December 11, 2017: This plugin is now available in the official WordPress repository [here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-sticky-widget-areas/).

A simple plugin to make the widget areas on the right side at /wp-admin/widgets.php sticky so they always remain in view when scrolling up/down.
